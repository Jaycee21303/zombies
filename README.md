# Temple Run Mini Clone

A lightweight, single-page Temple Run–style endless runner built with HTML5 canvas and vanilla JavaScript. The runner auto-sprints down three lanes while you dodge obstacles and grab coins.

## How to play
- Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
- The runner starts moving immediately.
- Controls: Left/Right (or A/D) to change lanes, Up/W/Space to jump, R to restart after a crash.
- Avoid obstacles, collect coins, and survive as long as possible to push your score higher.

## Development notes
- No build tools or dependencies are required; everything lives in `index.html`.
- The canvas resizes with the window so it can run in desktop or mobile browsers.
